# Atomix Anime
   This workflow describes the process of converting a standard video into an animated video using Animatediff nodes and specialized models. By leveraging these advanced tools, users can transform each frame of the original video into an animated counterpart, achieving a seamless and visually appealing animated sequence. The workflow ensures high-quality animation while preserving the essence of the original footage.
   ## Nodes Used
  ### Efficient Loader
This node is used to load all the input models and prompts in a single node, including the checkpoint model, LoRA model, strength of the LoRA model, and LoRA clip model strength.

### Animatediff Loader

This node is used to load the Animatediff models and add a context option to the model. The context option splits the input video into frames and sends the required number of frames to the Animatediff node, as the Animatediff node can process only a fixed number of frames at a time.

### HighRes-Fix Script

This node is used to upscale the images during generation instead of upscaling the video separately.

### KSampler Efficient
-   The K-Sampler Efficient node enhances the standard K-Sampler by optimizing the sampling process.
-   It employs advanced techniques to reduce the computational load, resulting in faster image generation.
-   This optimization maintains or improves image quality while significantly enhancing performance, making it more suitable for real-time applications or scenarios requiring high efficiency.
